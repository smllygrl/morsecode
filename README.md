# Morse Code Translator

This was the third challenge given to us at _nology.

Our build had to translate English to Morse Code and vice versa.

We were also required to build in testing with use of Jest.

I am really proud of my code on this build.

The main learnings I have had during this project are --
+ You can't test functions which interact with the DOM
+ Utilising the DOM in rendering information
+ Mapping through objects
+ General JavaScript competency

Items to be refined in my Translator --
+ Re-factor code so that it does not interact with the DOM, so testing can be implemented
